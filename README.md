# GameDie

This repository provides a class that represents a game die, such as the
six-sided dice used in traditional dice game. While the die defaults to 
six sides, the overloaded constructor allows the developer to customize
any size die (with at least one face). It also keeps track of how many
times a certain face has been rolled so that the fairness of the die
can be examined.
